# Practice Machine Learning 
Working through many different machine learning models on a variety of ideal data sets

The goal of this repository is work through different models and methods on ideal data sets. Different models, 
cost functions, visualizations and testing methods will be utilized. Large data cleaning is outside the scope of this
project.
